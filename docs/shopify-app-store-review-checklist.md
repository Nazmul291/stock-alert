---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Submission)

### 1. ❌ **Scope Permission Problem**
**Status:** FAILING
**Issue:** App is receiving only write scopes without read scopes
**Impact:** **AUTOMATIC REJECTION**

**What reviewers will find:**
- App cannot function with only write permissions
- Users will see errors when trying to use the app
- Violates basic functionality requirements

**Required Fix:**
1. Check Shopify Partner Dashboard configuration
2. Ensure requesting: `read_products,write_products,read_inventory,write_inventory`
3. Fix scope validation to require minimum read permissions

### 2. ❌ **OAuth Redirect Issue**
**Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED
**Issue:** OAuth callback redirect for embedded apps needs adjustment

**Current Implementation:**
- Redirects to `https://{shop}/admin/apps/{api_key}` ✅
- But app might not load properly if scopes are wrong ❌

**Required Fix:**
- Ensure OAuth completes successfully with proper scopes
- Test the complete flow from installation to app loading

### 3. ⚠️ **Missing App Listing Assets**
**Status:** NOT PROVIDED
**Required for submission:**
- App icon (512x512px)
