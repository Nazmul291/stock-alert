Our Next.js app properly implements App Bridge from Shopify CDN and session token auth following all docs - loading from cdn.shopify.com, fetching/validating tokens, refreshing each request. Yet automated checks show both "Using latest App Bridge" and "Using session tokens" as undetected despite dev store interactions and waiting multiple check cycles. What specific patterns does the checker need or how can we debug this? App: Stock Alert, Partner: NazmulCodes.
